# Train Board

I've always wanted a train departure/arrival board in my house, and that's what this project is: my attempt at that.

The physical train board prototype runs on a [32x64 LED Matrix Board](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/RGB-Matrix-P3-64x32) with an ESP32 for compute. Data is provided by National Rail's Darwin API and a custom Flask web application acts as middleware to communicate between Darwin and the ESP32, as the Darwin API is rich in data, but requires more complex coding to parse; so providing a middleware API gives more flexibility and control over the data going to the ESP32 - and takes the load off the embedded compute module.
